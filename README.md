# ROBOTIT THE ARDUINO ROBOT CHALLENGE

## 1.1 Article 1 conditions of participation
  The ROBOTIT competition is open to all students of the first STI2D of the Lycée de la MER.
  Each team is made up of 3, 4 or 5 students.
  

## 1.2 Article 2 conditions of the event
  The Elegoo® robot modified by the team must complete a course in three successive phases without
  interruption or intervention:
  
**Phase N ° 1:** From the starting line the robot must follow a black line 10mm wide laid
  On the ground.
  
**Phase N ° 2:** 
  At the end of the black line, an obstacle is placed (15.5 cm high block - see definition in
  additional documents) the robot must stop its movement in front of this stud.
  
**Phase N ° 3:** 
  On the block is placed a ping pong ball the robot must drop the ball without touching the plot.
  A classification by time will be carried out.
  Each robot error is sanctioned by a penalty of 10 seconds added to the robot path
  The development platform is in light-colored linoleum, starting and stopping areas indicated by colored adhesive tape (black).


##1.3 Article 3 technical conditions
  **The robot must meet the following rules:**
  ``
  - Maximum length 0.3m; Maximum width 0.2m; Maximum height 0.20m.

  - If there is an additional electronic circuit, it must be entirely designed and produced by the students on Arduino bases.
  - No participant may intervene on the development board during the event.
  - No connection between the start and the finish will be allowed.
  - The robot will have to move autonomously without connection of any kind (electrical, radio, mechanical, manual ...)
  - Are not authorized :
      Ignition devices.
      Animal propulsion.
      Thermal and chemical engines.
      The launching devices.

  - The track must be left clean after the passage of each robot.
  - At the end of the competition, the robot must be presented to the jury after each "run" and it must be intact.
  - The robot that leaves the track is penalized in time.
