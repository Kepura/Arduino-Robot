# ROBOTIT THE ARDUINO ROBOT CHALLENGE

## 1.1 Article 1 conditions of participation
<p style="align-items: center;">The ROBOTIT competition is open to all students of the first STI2D of the Lycée de la MER.
Each team is made up of 3, 4 or 5 students.</p>

1.2 Article 2 conditions of the event
The Elegoo® robot modified by the team must complete a course in three successive phases without
interruption or intervention:
Phase N ° 1: From the starting line the robot must follow a black line 10mm wide laid
On the ground.
Phase N ° 2: At the end of the black line, an obstacle is placed (15.5 cm high block - see definition in
additional documents) the robot must stop its movement in front of this stud.
Phase N ° 3: On the block is placed a ping pong ball the robot must drop the ball without touching
the plot.
A classification by time will be carried out.
Each robot error is sanctioned by a penalty of 10 seconds added to the
robot path
The development platform is in light-colored linoleum, starting and stopping areas indicated by
colored adhesive tape (black).
