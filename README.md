# ROBOTIT THE ARDUINO ROBOT CHALLENGE

## 1.1 Article 1 : conditions of participation
  The ROBOTIT competition is open to all students of the first STI2D of the Lycée de la MER.
  Each team is made up of 3, 4 or 5 students.
  

## 1.2 Article 2 : onditions of the event
  The Elegoo® robot modified by the team must complete a course in three successive phases without
  interruption or intervention:
  
**Phase N ° 1:** From the starting line the robot must follow a black line 10mm wide laid
  On the ground.
  
**Phase N ° 2:** 
  At the end of the black line, an obstacle is placed (15.5 cm high block - see definition in
  additional documents) the robot must stop its movement in front of this stud.
  
**Phase N ° 3:** 
  On the block is placed a ping pong ball the robot must drop the ball without touching the plot.
  A classification by time will be carried out.
  Each robot error is sanctioned by a penalty of 10 seconds added to the robot path
  The development platform is in light-colored linoleum, starting and stopping areas indicated by colored adhesive tape (black).


## 1.3 Article 3 : technical conditions
  **The robot must meet the following rules:**
  ```
  - Maximum length 0.3m; Maximum width 0.2m; Maximum height 0.20m.
  - No mass limit.
  - The product must be an original creation (no kit or commercial model). Geared motors are imposed and supplied in the number of four maximum.
  - The high school students will have to manufacture all the parts constituting the apparatus (with the exception of the following: screws, nuts, gears, axles, bearings springs, elastics, electronic components and electrical, electrical wires, cables).
  - If there is an additional electronic circuit, it must be entirely designed and produced by the students on Arduino bases.
  - No participant may intervene on the development board during the event.
  - No connection between the start and the finish will be allowed.
  - The robot will have to move autonomously without connection of any kind (electrical, radio, mechanical, manual ...)
  - Are not authorized :
      Ignition devices.
      Animal propulsion.
      Thermal and chemical engines.
      The launching devices.
      Filing or fixing anything on the track or next to it.

  - The robot must remain in contact with the ground.
  - The track must be left clean after the passage of each robot.
  - At the end of the competition, the robot must be presented to the jury after each "run" and it must be intact.
  - The robot that leaves the track is penalized in time.
  - The robot is "put down" at the starting point, it does not have to be pushed or launched to start.
  - The "run" cannot exceed the duration of 3 minutes.
  - Only team members can intervene during the passage on the track.
  - No challenge or pressure on the jury is accepted. If insisted, the robot is disqualified.
 📛 No original part of the Elegoo® robot should be modified.

## 1.4 Article 4 : constitution of the jury
  The jury is sovereign in its decisions. (Constitution see appendix)
  It may include representatives of the establishment, representatives of the industry, representatives
  academics, and competition partners.
  
  
## 1.5 Article 5 : The Challenges

  📢 Run Challenge (the fastest robot)
  📢 The winning robot will be determined by time.
  📢 Technical (the best achieved technical solution)

  The winning robot will be chosen by the jury based on the quality of the work even if it does not
  does not work.
  
  
## 1.6 Article 6 : educational approach
  It is essential that the robot is entirely designed by the students even if the chosen solutions do not
  are not very functional. The design of a system is a privileged moment of discovery and
  of knowledge appropriation.
  The competition is only there to showcase the work of the students.
  
  
## 1.7 Article 7 : Design follow-up.
  A technical file will be created throughout the course of the project. It will include all
  written traces of progress as well as computer files. The cost of the Robot will be monitored
  rigorous from the team and will be presented to the jury.
  
  
## 1.8 Article 8 : The regulations
  The organization reserves the right to modify the regulations at any time according to the requirements of the
  good progress of educational progress and the competition.
  
## 1.9 Article 9 : The competition
  The meeting will take place at the Lycée de la Mer at the end of the school year.
