# Student topic 4 ðŸ’»

## Design of a program to achieve the ROBOTIT challenge.
The purpose of the study is to carry out the program under ARDUINO to achieve the mission.

### Week 1
| Planned work | Time | Validation |
|--------:|----------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Presentation of the project and group training | 30min | âœ… |
| Study of Robot Elegoo. And functional tests <br>**-** *Robot movement activity* <br>**-** *Line follower activity* | 2h | âœ… |
| Study of the problem <br>**-** *Analysis of the need* <br>**-** *Use case diagram* <br>**-** *Requirements diagram (functional specifications)* | 30min | âœ… |

### Week 2
| Planned work | Time | Validation |
|--------:|----------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Search for solutions: ideas, design, material, principles. Sketch production commented <br>**-** *You can come up with anything and let your imagination run wild* <br>**-** *You must individually make proposals* | 2h30 | âœ… |
| Argued choice of a solution to develop. Distribution of tasks <br>**-** *As a group, you must evaluate the proposed solutions and define the solution you are going to work and assign tasks to you* | 30min | âœ… |

### Week 3
| Planned work | Time | Validation |
|--------:|----------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Model the arm and develop the servo's movement program <br>**-** *You have to write the algorithm allowing the robot to achieve its mission.
You must develop the program allowing to answer the solution chosen by the
group by integrating the travel procedures (see activities of the first week), and
of plot detection and servo movement in relation to students 1 and 3.* | 3h | âœ…~ |
