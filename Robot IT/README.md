# Student topic 4 ðŸ’»

## Design of a program to achieve the ROBOTIT challenge.
The purpose of the study is to carry out the program under ARDUINO to achieve the mission.

### Week 1
| Planned work | Time | Validation |
|--------:|----------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Presentation of the project and group training | 30min | âœ… |
| Study of Robot Elegoo. And functional tests <br>**-** *Robot movement activity* <br>**-** *Line follower activity* | 2h | âœ… |
| Study of the problem <br>**-** *Analysis of the need* <br>**-** *Use case diagram* <br>**-** *Requirements diagram (functional specifications)* | 30min | âœ… |

### Week 2
| Planned work | Time | Validation |
|--------:|----------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Search for solutions: ideas, design, material, principles. Sketch production commented <br>**-** *You can come up with anything and let your imagination run wild* <br>**-** *You must individually make proposals* | 2h30 | âœ… |
| Argued choice of a solution to develop. Distribution of tasks <br>**-** *As a group, you must evaluate the proposed solutions and define the solution you are going to work and assign tasks to you* | 30min | âœ… |

### Week 3
| Planned work | Time | Validation |
|--------:|----------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Model the arm and develop the servo's movement program You need to model your solution. Carry out the studies, choices and simulations allowing you to
to validate your system.
Verify the availability of the equipment and make orders if the need is validated by your
teacher.
Watch the video about the servo programming under ARDUINO and develop the
program to respond to the solution chosen by the group. | 3h | ~âœ…~ |
